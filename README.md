#List Comprehension
This started off as an attempt to implement list comprehensions in C++ because I like the syntactic sugar and python is nice, but became an exercise in template metaprogramming as I created my own version of boost phoneix library for lazy evaluation expressions with generics.

Or something like that. Who knows. Could just be bullshit.

I also created a handy tuple helper header-only library that I intend to make into it's own repository later.

##Files:
- `tuple-utils.h`, `utils.h`, `variadic-utils.h`: Various template tuple helpers
- `lambda-utils.h`: A very interesting file with some interesting metaprogramming.
- TODO: More
